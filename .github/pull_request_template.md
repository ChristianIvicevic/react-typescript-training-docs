Please, go through these steps before you submit a PR.

1. Make sure that your PR is not a duplicate.
2. If not, then make sure that:
    - You have done your changes in a separate branch. Branches MUST have descriptive names that start with either the `fix/` or `feature/` prefixes. Good examples are: `fix/signin-issue` or `feature/issue-templates`.
    - You have a descriptive commit message with a short title (first line).
    - You have only one commit (if not, squash them into one commit).
    - If you add new commits are preparing your branch, amend your commit (`git commit --amend`).
3. **After** these steps, you're ready to open a pull request.
    - Your pull request MUST NOT target the `master` branch on this repository. You probably want to target `develop` instead.
    - Give a descriptive title to your PR.
    - Provide a description of your changes.
    - Put `Closes #XXXX` in your comment to auto-close the issue that your PR fixes (if such).

IMPORTANT: Please review the [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) file for detailed contributing guidelines.
