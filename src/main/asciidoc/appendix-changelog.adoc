=== Added
* Introduced a Changelog page where all notable changes to this project will be documented.

=== Changed
* Editor screenshots have been updated to use a light theme to be more pleasant to watch (was previously a dark theme).
* The table of contents expands all headers right away (was previously hiding certain sections).
* Replaced informal occurences of the word _typo(s)_ with the word _misspelling(s)_.

=== Fixed
* A misspelling of the word _operator_ in the section about the <<advanced-features-of-the-type-system.adoc#indexed-access-operator,indexed access operator>>.
