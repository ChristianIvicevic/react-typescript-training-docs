This section of the documentation introduces you to the Typescript programming language, its type annotations and advantages over Javascript.
Furthermore it includes details about the basic data types as well as more advanced types.

[[what-is-typescript]]
== What is Typescript?
Typescript is a statically typed subset of Javascript, i.e. all valid Javascript code is valid Typescript code, but not the other way round.
The term statically describes that code written in Typescript can be checked for errors during compilation even before runtime.
This in turn can reveal bugs that are usually difficult to debug once an application is already running.
Static type-safety is enabled by so-called type annotations describing and documenting your code and its correct usage.
With those key features you can write robust and safe code with less bugs and erratic behavior.
Furthermore consuming third party libraries containing type annotations becomes much easier since you don't have to guess parameter types as code is self-documenting:

.VS Code displaying type annotations when invoking code completion
[#img-is-prime-1]
image::is-prime-1.png[]

In <<img-is-prime-1>> you see that the `isPrime` method has one parameer named `arg` of type `number`.
Trying to supply an argument that isn't sensible yields an error in the editor:

.Typescript will prevent assigning arguments that are imcompatible with parameters
[#img-is-prime-2]
image::is-prime-2.png[]

In Vanilla Javascript and without relying on sophisticated tools, you'd see no errors and your application would behave erroneously in the browser causing cryptic error messages.
Finding these errors during or before compilation in the first place helps to reduce time debugging or fixing bugs.

Microsoft is developing Typescript to make Javascript scale and more bearable at the cost of some overhead writing slightly more code, but strictly checking everything you attempt to do.

[[type-annotations]]
== Type Annotations
Type annotations in Typescript are lightweight ways to record the intended contract of a function or variable.
By appending `: Type` to those elements you can annotate them and make the compiler aware of their contracts as follows:

[source,typescript]
----
// Assigning some variables
const variable1: number = 42;
const variable2: string = "Hello, Typescript!";
const variable3: boolean = "wrong type";
//    ~~~~~~~~~ <1>

// Defining a custom function
/**
 * This function takes a number as an argument and returns a boolean.
 */
function isThirteen(arg: number): boolean {
    return arg === 13;
}

// Attempting to call the custom function and store the return value
const result1: boolean = isThirteen(42);
const result2: boolean = isThirteen("42");
//                                  ~~~~ <2>
const result3: string = isThirteen(42);
//    ~~~~~~~ <3>
----
<1> `error: Type '"wrong type"' is not assignable to type 'boolean'.`
<2> `error: Argument of type '"42"' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.`
<3> `error: Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'string'.`

The previous snippet shows that even minor additional type annotations help to track down illegal assignments.
Not only variables but parameters and return values can be annotated to make the compiler keep track of them and notify you if you make a mistake.
However the previous snippet contains a lot of verbose annotations and fortunately, most of them can be removed.
Typescript is able to infer a lot of information and implicit types just from their usage.
The valid lines of the previous snippet can be written as follows:

[source,typescript]
----
const variable1 = 42;
const variable2 = "Hello, Typescript!";

/**
 * This function takes a number as an argument and returns a boolean.
 */
function isThirteen(arg: number) {
    return arg === 13;
}

const result1 = isThirteen(42);
----

Notice that by assigning a constant value of a specific type will narrow down the type of the respective variable, i.e. `variable1` must be number and cannot be anything else after assigning `42`.
Hovering over the `isThirteen` function in VS Code will yield the infered return type annotation:

.Even though we haven't explicitly declared the return type, Typescript understands that the `isThirteen` method is returning a `boolean` value
[#type-inference]
image::type-inference.png[]

[[basic-types]]
== Basic Types
Typescript is aware of the usual Javascript data types `boolean`, `number` and `string`, but it allows for more complex types.

[[arrays]]
=== Arrays
Typescript allows you to work with arrays that are defined like in most other programming languages as follows:

[source,typescript]
----
const list: number[] = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5];
----

[TIP]
====
Once again the type annotation `number[]` in the previous snippet can (and should) be omitted, since it can be infered from the right hand side.
For the purpose of this documentation however, we're usually not omitting them in the upcoming examples to explicitly describe the types we're working with.
====

[[read-only-arrays]]
=== Read-only Arrays
Immutability is another tool to rely on when writing robust code, so Typescript provides the ability to annotate arrays as read-only.
This means that you will not be able to directly push, remove, shift or replace elements to prevent unexpected mutations.
To declare a read-only array you have to write `readonly Type[]` as follows:

[source,typescript]
----
const list: readonly number[] = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5];
list.push(9);
//   ~~~~ <1>
list[2] = 0;
//~~~~~ <2>
----
<1> `error: Property 'push' does not exist on type 'readonly number[]'.`
<2> `Index signature in type 'readonly number[]' only permits reading.`

[NOTE]
====
In order to make a mutable copy of a read-only array use the spread syntax:

[source,typescript]
----
const pi: readonly number[] = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5];
const newPi: number[] = [...pi];
----

Even without the explicit `number[]` type annotation `newPi` has the same mutable type.
====

[WARNING]
====
You might be tempted to make a mutable copy of any read-only array, but beware that copying arrays of objects will only copy their references.
The consequence is the following unexpected behavior:

[source,typescript]
----
type Entity = { id: number }; // <1>
const entities: readonly Entity[] = [
    { id: 1 },
    { id: 2 },
    { id: 3 },
];

const entitiesCopy = [...entities]; // <2>
entitiesCopy[1].id = 13; // <3>
const isSame = entities[1].id === entitiesCopy[1].id; // <4>
----
<1> We haven't introduced this notation of type aliases yet, but basically it is a type called `Entity` which can store a numerical id.
More information on type aliases can be seen in the section on the topic of advanced types.
<2> Unexpected behavior: this is NOT an actual clone of all objects and it copies only the references.
<3> This will mutate both arrays, even our "read-only" one therefore...
<4> ...both arrays have been mutated and `isSame` will be true since both arrays reference the same objects.

For actual immutable data you have to make sure that `id` in `Entity` is read-only as well and/or that you do not attempt to set any values of objects and replace them entirely instead.
A combination of both suggestions is this:

[source,typescript]
----
type Entity = { readonly id: number }; // <1>
const entities: readonly Entity[] = [
    { id: 1 },
    { id: 2 },
    { id: 3 },
];

const entitiesCopy = [...entities]; // <2>
entitiesCopy[1].id = 13;
//              ~~ <3>
entitiesCopy[1] = { id: 13 }; // <4>
const isSame = entities[1].id === entitiesCopy[1].id; // <5>
----
<1> The `id` property is annotated with `readonly`.
<2> This is STILL a new array with copies of the old object references.
<3> `error: Cannot assign to 'id' because it is a read-only property.`
<4> Instead, we can assign a completely new object.
<5> Thus, `isSame` will be false since we replace the object reference in `entitiesCopy` with a completely new object.

This example demonstrates that marking something as read-only isn't the same as it being immutable.
====

[[tuples]]
=== Tuples
While arrays are dynamic in size and usually homogenous, tuples can be used to describe arrays of fixed length whose element types are heterogenous but known, such as key/value pairs:

[source,typescript]
----
const numericValue = 42;
const kvPair1: [string, number] = ["key", numericValue];
const kvPair2: [string, number] = ["key", 31];
const kvPair3: [string, number] = ["key", "value"];
//                                        ~~~~~~~ <1>
----
<1> `error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.`

Furthermore accessing the elements of this array correctly retrieves their types allowing safe method calls such as `kvPair1[0].substring(1)`.
On top of that, accessing elements out of bounds, i.e. trying to read `kvPair2[5]`, will fail already during compilation since tuples have a fixed size:

[source,typescript]
----
const noValue = kvPair2[5];
//                      ~ <1>
----
<1> `error: Tuple type '[string, number]' of length '2' has no element at index '5'.`

[[enums]]
=== Enums
A feature native to Typescript are enumerations which are used to assign human readable names to compile-time constant values and group them together.

[source,typescript]
----
enum Shapes {
    Circle,
    Square,
    Triangle,
}

const someShape = Shapes.Circle;
const someOtherShape = Shapes.DoesNotExist;
//                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~ <1>
----
<1> `error: Property 'DoesNotExist' does not exist on type 'typeof Shapes'.`

In enums zero is always assigned to the first element with all other elements being increments of the previous.
Thus the previous snippet is equivalent to the following:

[source,typescript]
----
enum Shapes {
    Circle = 0,
    Square = 1,
    Triangle = 2,
}
----

However, you can assign custom numerical or string values to your enum items:

[source,typescript]
----
enum Shapes {
    Circle = 2,
    Square = 4,
    Triangle = 8,
}

enum ErrorMessages {
    InternalServerError = "An internal server error has occurred.",
    NotFound = "The requested resource wasn't found on the server.",
}
----

Enums allow you to perform reverse lookups wherein numerical values can be mapped to the respective stringified name as follows:

[source,typescript]
----
enum Shapes {
    Circle,
    Square,
    Triangle,
}

const shapeName: string = Shapes[1];
console.log(shapeName); // <1>
----
<1> Displays `Square`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This reverse lookup does not work for enums with string values.
====

[WARNING]
====
Be careful when working with enums, especially when serializing their values to a storage like a database.
By adding or removing new enum values previously stored values might no longer align with the names and values defined in your code!
In order to prevent anomalies you should always explicitly assign values to enum items and write tests that assert these values stay the same and/or are in the same order.
====

[[constant-enums]]
=== Constant Enums
When compiling enums a lot of code is internally created to allow reverse lookups which might not be necessary most of the time.
You can optimize this by enabling so-called type erasure for enums by making them constant and inlining their values.
This means no traces of the actual enumeration will be in the generated code which transforms the following snippet

[source,typescript]
----
const enum Colors {
    Red,
    Black,
    Green,
    White,
}

const colors = [Colors.Red, Colors.Black, Colors.Green, Colors.White];
----

into this terse definition

[source,typescript]
----
var colors = [0, 1, 2, 3];
----

instead of

[source,typescript]
----
"use strict";
var Colors;
(function (Colors) {
    Colors[Colors["Red"] = 0] = "Red";
    Colors[Colors["Black"] = 1] = "Black";
    Colors[Colors["Green"] = 2] = "Green";
    Colors[Colors["White"] = 3] = "White";
})(Colors || (Colors = {}));
const colors = [Colors.Red, Colors.Black, Colors.Green, Colors.White];
----

which reduces bundle size significantly.

[[any]]
=== Any
When using 3rd party libraries or working with dynamic data that you can't explicitly type you can opt-out of type checking entirely by using the `any` type which drops you into the Wild West seizing all rules on a lawless frontier:

[source,typescript]
----
let anyVariable: any = 42;
anyVariable = "this can be a string as well";
anyVariable = false;

anyVariable.will.cause.a.runtimeError();

let anyList: any[] = [42, "variable", false];
anyList[1] = 314;
----

Nevertheless, `any` can be useful to opt-out of type checking in legacy code that you are about to migrate piece by piece from Javascript to Typescript.

[CAUTION]
====
The `any` type should be used only when you definitely need it.
You don't only lose type checking capabilities for anything annotated with `any`, you will even lose code completion capabilities of those elements.
Furthermore using `any` can cause errors that could've been caught during compile time to happen during runtime.
Be careful when relying on this type.
====

[[unknown]]
=== Unknown
Typescript has introduced the `unknown` type as a type-safe and strict alternative to `any`.
You've seen that you can assign virtually ``any``thing (duh.) to a variable annotated with `any`.
Since you opt-out of type checking using the following snippet will compile, but will throw errors during runtime:

[source,typescript]
----
let variable: any = 42;
variable = "string";
variable = false;

const value1 = variable.call.some.method.thatDoesntExist();
const value2 = variable[3];
const value3 = new variable();
----

In order to prevent those erroneous calls and assignments allowed by `any` you can leverage `unknown`.
It allows assigning `any` value to it, but unlike `any` you can only assign an `unknown` variable to `any` or `unknown`, i.e. assigning an `unknown` to `boolean` or `number` will fail.
Furthermore no attempted method calls or property access are allowed at all.

[source,typescript]
----
let variable: unknown = 42;
variable = "string";
variable = false;

const value1 = variable.call.some.method.thatDoesntExist();
//             ~~~~~~~~ <1>
const value2 = variable[3];
//             ~~~~~~~~ <2>
const value3 = new variable();
//                 ~~~~~~~~ <3>

const anyVariable: any = variable;
const unknownVariable: unknown = variable;
const boolVariable: boolean = variable;
//    ~~~~~~~~~~~~ <4>
----
<1> `error: Object is of type 'unknown'.`
<2> `error: Object is of type 'unknown'.`
<3> `error: Object is of type 'unknown'.`
<4> `error: Type 'unknown' is not assignable to type 'boolean'.`

[IMPORTANT]
====
An `unknown` variable should only be used to read and write unknown data and nothing else.
====

[[null-and-undefined]]
=== Null and Undefined
Typescript distinguishes between variables defined as `null` or actually being `undefined`.
Variables eplicitly have to be assigned `null` in order to describe that there is no data.
`undefined` however is the value of variables that haven't been defined at all or explicitly being assigned `undefined`.
Colloquially `undefined` is equivalent to an optional value that might not have to be set (yet).

What's awesome about Typescript is, that it is able to deduce whether a variable is defined in the current scope when you try to access it:

[source,typescript]
----
const someObjectThatMightBeUndefined = /* ... */; // <1>

const value1 = someObjectThatMightBeUndefined.getValue();
//             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ <2>

if (someObjectThatMightBeUndefined !== undefined) {
    const value2 = someObjectThatMightBeUndefined.getValue(); // <3>
}
----
<1> Without explicitly denoting the type of this variable, assume that it might be `undefined`.
<2> `error: Object is possibly 'undefined'.`
<3> This works just fine, since Typescript knows the object definitely isn't `undefined` in this scope and we even get code completion when attempting to call `getValue`.

[NOTE]
====
In the official coding guidelines of the Typescript and VS Code team `null` is forbidden entirely and they enforce to use `undefined` only.
This reduces possible errors and confusion between the two types and their interpretation in business logic.
====

[[never]]
=== Never

[IMPORTANT]
====
The following section about `never` is extremely abstract, but we didn't want to skip listing `never` as a basic type.
Usually you should almost never (duh.) have to deal with this type unless something is really too complex for the compiler to resolve, like `Array.reduce` starting on an empty untyped array.
====

Values of type `never` should, as the name implies, never occur at all.
This is the case for methods that throw errors since those methods won't return an actual value along this path (not even `undefined`).
They technically return "something" of type `never` which indicates an unreachable end point.

Furthermore in some edge cases where Typescript isn't able to infer types from usage, it will default to `never` for safety.
Using the `Array.reduce` method on an empty array as the initial value will cause Typescript to bail on the following snippet:

[source,typescript]
----
const neverArray = [1, 2, 3].reduce((acc, next) => acc, []);
//                                                      ~~ <1>
----
<1> This array is considered to be of type `never[]` as Typescript cannot safely deduce its type.
This prevents you to do virtually anything to it as Typescript wouldn't otherwise be able to check whether your operations are safe.

From the usage of the second argument `[]` it is unclear of which type it is, not even `any[]` which would allow possibly undefined operations such as `acc.thisWillFail()`.
The type `never[]` is considered to be an array that must be empty at all times.
Surprisingly enough, even `unknown[]` would be semantically wrong as it is unclear which types are allowed to be pushed onto the array.
Therefore `[]` is by default of type `never[]` and thus is `neverArray` since our snippet basically returns the initial value.

Even the following snippet that actually tries to work with the accumulator value will fail:

[source,typescript]
----
const array = [1, 2, 3].reduce((acc, next) => [...acc, next], []);
//                                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ <1>
----
<1> `error: Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'never'.`

Attempting to append a `number` to a `never[]` which isn't posible will fail since `never` is incompatible to all other types, even `any` and `never[]`.

[NOTE]
====
At some point you will stumble upon the above issue with `Array.reduce` and it can be easily fixed by giving it a type hint using <<#generics,generics>>:

[source,typescript]
----
const array = [1, 2, 3].reduce<number[]>((acc, next) => [...acc, next], []);
//                             ~~~~~~~~ <1>
----
<1> Type of the initial (and return) value, in our case making it an array of numbers.
====

[[advanced-types]]
== Advanced Types
Most of the intimidating magic in Typescript stems from the type system and writing custom types using a vast array of syntactical elements and helper types.
We will be introducing (rather abstract) examples where we want to type complex objects.
For even more advanced types please refer to the chapter <<advanced-features-of-the-type-system.adoc#,Advanced Features of the Type System>>.

[[type-aliases]]
=== Type Aliases
You can use type aliases to create a new name for a possibly complex type.
This is useful if you are for example describing the attributes of an UI component and want to collapse them into a single type:

[source,typescript]
----
type ComponentProperties = {
    active: boolean;
    alignText: Alignment;
    className: string;
    disabled: boolean;
    // ...
};
----

Type aliases can be used to rename various different types:

[source,typescript]
----
type Props = ComponentProperties; // <1>
type Action = () => void; // <2>
type NumberPredicate = (value: number) => boolean; // <2>
----
<1> Component properties in React are usually called Props.
<2> These are function signatures.

[[intersection-types]]
=== Intersection Types
Often it is necessary to drop the object-oriented codestyle and work with injected attributes using mixins.
In the context of functional programming this is related to higher-order functions or in the context of React previously known as working with higher-order components.

Using such a mixin will yield an object that has been extended with further properties.
One can design a function, that merges two objects of type `A` and `B` into one object of type `A & B` called their intersection.
The types for the upcoming example are the following:

[source,typescript]
----
type TypeA = {
    stringVariableA: string;
    numberVariableA: number;
};

type TypeB = {
    booleanVariableB: boolean;
    functionInB(): void;
};
----

Defining their intersection is a one-liner

[source,typescript]
----
type Intersection = TypeA & TypeB;
----

which is equivalent to this:

[source,typescript]
----
type Intersection = {
    stringVariableA: string;
    numberVariableA: number;
    booleanVariableB: boolean;
    functionInB(): void;
};
----

The function `merge` now has two parametes of types `TypeA` and `TypeB` and returns the intersection of type `TypeA & TypeB`:

[source,typescript]
----
const merge = (objA: TypeA, objB: TypeB): (TypeA & TypeB) // <1>
    => ({...objA, ...objB}); // <2>
----
<1> Alternatively `Intersection` instead of `TypeA & TypeB` from the previous snippets.
<2> This spreads the two arguments `objA` and `objB` into a new object.

[[union-types]]
=== Union Types
Another useful syntactic element are union types `A | B` of two types `A` and `B` used to describe an "either/inclusive or"-type (depending on context).
Functions don't have to have parameters restricted to a single type, they can declare multiple types for a parameter:

[source,typescript]
----
const unionMethod = (arg: number | string) => /* ... */; // <1>
----
<1> This method accepts either a `number` or a `string` and is internally implemented in a way that both types are handled correctly.

A similar notion exists for variables that needs some intuition when working with them:

[source,typescript]
----
class Human {
    public speak() { /* ... */ }
    public move() { /* ... */ }
}

class Insect {
    public move() { /* ... */ }
}

const entity: Human | Insect = /* ... */;
entity.move();
entity.speak();
//     ~~~~~ <1>
----
<1> `error: Property 'speak' does not exist on type 'Human | Insect'. Property 'speak' does not exist on type 'Insect'.`

When attempting to access members of the `entity` variable Typescript can certainly assume that it has the `move` method since it is contained in both `Human` and `Insect`.
However trying to invoke `speak` might fail during runtime depending on the actual type of `entity` since there is no distinction between either types yet and Typescript will not allow the compilation of this unsafe snippet.

[NOTE]
====
To actually distinguish between union types you have to use so-called <<advanced-features-of-the-type-system.adoc#type-guards,type guards>>.
====

Union types allow you to denote optional / possibly undefined variables as follows:

[source,typescript]
----
type Props = {
    requiredString: string;
    optionalNumber: number | undefined;
};
----

In fact Typescript provides the question mark operator `?` to remove the necessity of adding `| undefined` to all optional variables:

[source,typescript]
----
type Props = {
    requiredString: string;
    optionalNumber?: number;
};
----

[[generics]]
=== Generics

[[basics-of-generics]]
==== Basics of Generics
It can happen that you end up with a type, method or class that you can apply similar in the context of various types.
A rather artificial example is the following:

[source,typescript]
----
const numberToString = (arg: number) => `${arg}`;
const booleanToString = (arg: boolean) => `${arg}`;
const dateToString = (arg: Date) => `${arg}`;
----

You'll notice that the only difference is the annotated type so you can use a union type to combine all allowed types:

[source,typescript]
----
const toString = (arg: number | boolean | Date) => `${arg}`;
----

This can end up being quite convoluted when you support many types and just want a generic method for virtually all types.
Thus generics have been borrowed from other programming languages that are placeholders for types:

[source,typescript]
----
const toString = <ArgType>(arg: ArgType) => `${arg}`; // <1>
----
<1> This method now has a new special type parameter called `ArgTyp` enclosed by angle brackets.
It behaves like a placeholder where each occurence of it would be replaced by the supplied type.
Writing `toString<number>(...)` indicates that `arg` is of type `number` etc.

Now it ispossible to invoke this method as follows:

[source,typescript]
----
const string1 = toString<number>(42);
const string2 = toString<boolean>(false);
const string3 = toString<number>("string");
//                               ~~~~~~~~ <1>
const string4 = toString(42);
//                       ~~ <2>
----
<1> `error: Argument of type '"string"' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.`
<2> Often there is no need to explicitly write generic types for invocations since Typescript can infer them from the usage.
Here 42 is a number, thus this line is treated as `toString<number>(42)`.

Generics exist for classes and other types as well.
It is possible to define a special type that makes each type `T` optional by mapping it onto `T | undefined`:

[source,typescript]
----
type Maybe<T> = T | undefined;
----

Example usages are as follows:

[source,typescript]
----
// This type alias...
type Simple = Maybe<number>;
// ...is equivalent to this manually written type.
type Simple = number | undefined;

// This type alias...
type ResponseCode = Maybe<{ value: number; }>;
// ...is equivalent to this manually written type.
type ResponseCode = { value: number; } | undefined;
----

Generics enable you to write generic predicates which take any argument and return a boolean value.
Such a predicate is usually used for conditions to check in methods such as `Array.filter` or `Array.some`:

[source,typescript]
----
type Predicate<T> = (arg: T) => boolean; // <1>

const isThirteen: Predicate<number> = (arg) => arg === 13; // <2>
//                                     ~~~ <3>

const array = [1, 2, 13, 4, 13, 5];
const thirteens = array.filter(isThirteen);
const containsThirteen = array.some(isThirteen);
----
<1> This type describes a function that maps any type onto a boolean.
<2> We define this method to be a predicate operating on numbers.
<3> Notice how we are not explicitly writing `arg: number`.
This is already implied by the definition of `Predicate` because `arg` must be a number.

[[showcase-generics-in-legacy-react-class-components]]
==== Showcase: Generics in Legacy React Class Components
Let's have a look at a sophisticated example of generics: the use in legacy class components of React.
A simplified base class for components is this one:

[source,typescript]
----
abstract class Component<Props, State> { // <1>
    public readonly props: Props; // <2>
    protected readonly state: State; // <3>

    /* ... */

    public setState(newState: State) { // <4> <5>
        /* ... */
    }
}
----
<1> Our `Component` class expects two generic type arguments `Props` and `State` that can be used to describe the type of the internal props and state.
<2> The internal props passed on to a component have the type `Props`.
<3> The internal state of the component has the type `State`.
<4> Internally the actual `Component.setState` function in React is more complex, we have simplified this example intentionally.
<5> This method expects a `newState` object that must be compatible with the internal state which is made sure using the `State` type annotation.

A custom component can extend the base `Component` class and pass on its prop and state types:

[source,typescript jsx]
----
type ButtonProps = {
    className: string;
    text: string;
};

type ButtonState = {
    isActive: boolean;
};

class Button extends Component<ButtonProps, ButtonState> { // <1>
    public void render() { // <2>
        return (
            <button // <3>
                className={`btn btn--is-${this.state.isActive ? "active" : "inactive"} ${this.props.className}`} // <4>
                onClick={this.onClick}  // <5>
            >
                {this.props.text} // <6>
            </button>
        );
    }

    private readonly onClick = () => { // <7>
        this.setState({ isActive: true, doesNotExist: 13 }); // <8>
        //                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~ // <9>
    };

    // ...
}
----
<1> We define our `Button` component and pass on our custom `ButtonProps` and `ButtonState` types to be passed to the parent class to be used as types for the internal `props` and `state` object.
<2> The `render` method in React returns the actual component to be rendered using a special HTML-like syntax called JSX.
Don't worry if you're not familiar with this, just try to understand the way we can access the correct `props` and `state` variables.
<3> We return a standard button HTML element.
<4> The button has the class name defined in the `className` prop and depending on the value of the `isActive` state variable either `btn--is-active` or `btn--is-inactive` as an additional class name.
<5> Furthermore we bind a custom method to handle the `onClick` event.
<6> The button displays the text supplied via the `text` prop.
<7> Our custom event handler for the `onClick` event which is wired up in the `render` method above.
<8> We have access to the `setState` method of the parent class and can attempt to set the `state` variable.
<9> `error: Property 'doesNotExist' does not exist on type 'ButtonState'.`
